# Hugo Webpack Demo

This repo is a demo on how you can setup webpack with Hugo.

To run this, you will need to have yarn, and hugo installed.

With a little modification, you can use the webpack dev server instead of the one Hugo comes with.
[This pull request](https://github.com/tegandbiscuits/hugo-webpack-demo/pull/1/files) shows how to set that up.
